<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For my first angular app I built a prototype application for users to find currently active players within the League of Legends universe, Ive always found that one struggles to find proper duo partners.</p>
<p>So the idea was to create an App that create a easy to use flow of user interaction to find friends and players online.</p>
<h2>Home page layout</h2>
<p>Once logged in, the user will be greeted with a home page with a small introduction and a list of friends currently playing League of Legends.</p>

<h2>Find a friend layout</h2>
<p>This page will display all players currently online, here you will be able to add a friend.</p>
